The real estate market is significantly impacted by various geospatial factors, neighborhood characteristics, and broader economic indicators. However, traditional valuation methods often fall short in capturing the complex interactions among these variables, leading to inaccurate and biased price predictions. This issue is particularly relevant in an industry where precise price estimation is essential for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals aiming to make informed decisions. A more accurate and dynamic model, which incorporates these multiple dimensions, is necessary to address the limitations of conventional approaches.
Our approach leverages machine learning and geospatial data to develop a predictive model capable of estimating real estate prices with greater accuracy. By integrating property-specific attributes, neighborhood factors, and dynamic economic indicators, this project aims to capture both the localized and broad market trends that influence property values. In addition, our proposed solution includes the development of an application or dashboard for real-time price estimation and visualizations, providing users with insights into key factors driving property prices.
